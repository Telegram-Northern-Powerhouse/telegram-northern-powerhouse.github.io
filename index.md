## Telegram Code Of Conduct

The telegram channel is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code
of conduct applies to all telegram spaces, both online and off.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled
from these spaces at the discretion of the admin team. Some telegram
spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available
to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these
rules.
